# Exploring Cryptocurrency Derivatives Trading with Data
Welcome to our data science project, where we take a closer look at cryptocurrency derivatives trading using data analysis. 🚀📈

## Project Overview 🌐
In this project, we'll explore cryptocurrency derivatives trading from different angles. We'll use data engineering, predictive modeling, and creative data analysis to uncover trading strategies, manage risks, and gain valuable insights.

## Assignment Overview 📚
During this 4-hour assignment, we tackled three key questions to explore various aspects of data science and engineering:

- **Q1: Data Engineering Skills 🛠️**\
We delved into data manipulation, transformation, and cleaning to make sure our data is well-organized and ready for analysis.

- **Q2: Functions and Regression 📉**\
We created and applied functions and regression models to discover patterns, understand relationships between variables, and potentially make predictions about future cryptocurrency prices.

- **Q3: Creative Data Exploration and Analysis 🎨📊**\
We had the freedom to creatively explore and analyze the data, uncovering hidden trends, insights, and stories within the world of cryptocurrency trading.
